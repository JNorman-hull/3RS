Deployment_summary_ROI.xlsx provides a summary of key events which occured during passage of fish backpack and BDS sensors.
Raw_data_interpretation.docx provides the column header names for the raw sensor data (also outlined below).

## Fish backpack sensor data

The files F02, F03, F10, F14, F18 and F19 are raw data outputs from individual fish backpack sensors during singular passage.
The fish backpack sensor data files do not have column headers. The columns corrospond to the following headers.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time (ms) | Battery voltage (v) | Total water pressure (mbar) | Temperature pressure sensor (c) | Acc X | Acc Y | Acc Z | Rot X | Rot Y | Rot Z | Mag X | Mag Y | Mag Z |

## Barotrauma detection system (BDS) sensor data

The files U01, U02, U03, U04, U06, U07, U08, U09, U10, U11 and U12 are raw data outputs from individual BDS sensors during singular passage.
The BDS sensor data files do not have column headers. The columns corrospond to the following headers.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time (s) | PL (hPa) | PC (hPa) | PR (hPa)) | AX (m/s2) | AY (m/s2) | AZ (m/s2) |
